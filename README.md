The following additions have been made to the HTML and JavaScript of this folder
- in the HTML: Addition all rows were created to represent the rest of the time slots, but the 1PM - 5PM id's were marks with 13 - 17 so they could be read correctly ordered in the for loop
-In the JavaScript: the code inside the currentDateCalc function uses the day.js library and formating to display the current Month, day , year and time through the currentDay variable
thats displayed as .text .
